# Personal-Portfolio
This is my personal Portfolio  Website. Designed with HTML, CSS &amp; Vanilla Javascript 
This Is My First Project of my Diploma In Computer Engineering.
This Project has basic HTML which took me five days to design and write the codes .
but its CSS is quite tough for me because i am just a noob in this programming field it took me
20 days to write CSS. and it has Simple Javascript 
If You Want to download the projects and images first create a folder for the project then put html,css and javascript inside it 
create a folder named"images" and put all the images inside that
